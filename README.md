# Trilium Sender
Trilium Sender is a simple Android application for sending images and notes to [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium).

It's not a full Android port of Trilium and it's not meant to be one - instead it's supposed to cover only following use cases:

* write plain text notes and send them to Trilium
* send images (photos) to Trilium

Specifically, this app doesn't support reading or modifying existing notes, it's "write-only". If you need to access your notes in the mobile phone, you can use Trilium's [mobile frontend](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Mobile-frontend).

Both notes and images are saved as new notes under "day note" in Trilium server.
